# Architectural requirement
- Intel 32 or 64 bit processor

# User Interface 
- Command User Interface

# Technology used 
- Programming using C++ 

# About Standard Template Library
- In this project we emulate almost all the data structures and its functionalty which are available in STL

- In this project we have created eight data structures as follows:

1 :Singly Linear LinkList

2 :Singly Circular LinkList

3 :Doubly Linear LinkList

4 :Doubly Circular LinkList

5 :Stack using LinkList

6 :Stack using Array

7 :Queue using LinkList

8 :Binary Search Tree (BST)

# I Have implemented functionality in Original STL:

1 : Insert Node at First

2 : Insert Node at Last

3 : Insert Node at given position

4 : Delete Node at First

5 : Delete Node at Last

6 : Delete Node at given position

7 : Count Total Number of Nodes

8 : Display all the Nodes

9 : First Occurance of element in the given list

10 : Last Occurance of element in the given list

11 : All Occurance of element in the given list

12 : Reverse the list
